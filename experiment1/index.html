				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>The idea of this experiment is to remix a Glitch project and upload it to this website.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>There was a provided Glitch project that would iterate through text, look for keywords, and replace them with random entries from corresponding lists. I wrote my own lists and text for the project to combine, changed the glow color of the text box, and moved the code to this webpage.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>The instructions were pretty thorough, so I was able to complete the experiment by myself without major issues except for the fact that the page wouldn't show any text within my generation box. I couldn't figure out why, so I just left the experiment alone for a day, and when I came back to it, the text was there.</p>
